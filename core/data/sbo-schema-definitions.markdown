# SBO Schema Definitions for Firestore

This document outlines the schema definitions for a SaaS tool providing digital solutions to businesses, implemented in Firestore. The schemas support complex relationships where a single identity (owner or authorized personnel) can host multiple businesses and identities (partners), and a business can host multiple identities (employees, customers, clients) and other businesses (contractors, partners, suppliers). The main collections are `sbo_accounts` for small business owners and authorized personnel accounts, and `sbo_connections` for all other entities, with business entities stored in `sbo_connections/entities`.
